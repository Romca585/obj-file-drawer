Everything is working as per assignment description.
Just a few notes to the grader: The uploading of large files takes a good amount of time. Never the less,
this could be because of the server being busy, since each individual element in the array needs to get uploaded.

I had a chat with the professor about what exactly is being uploaded to the server, and although he did say it is not the
ideal solution, he does not see it being not allowed.

Similarly I asked him in class if he wanted the buttons to be labelled as Display # or should I put the name of the file.
He said it doesn't matter, would be easier for the TA if they are labelled as the filename. Which is what I did.
